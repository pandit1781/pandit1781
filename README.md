Hi there. 👋 Thanks for stopping by! My name is Edgars (or simply Edgar). I´m from 🇱🇻 , now living in :de: . 

:chart_with_upwards_trend: I recently graduated from Advanced Data Analytics Bootcamp @ [neuefische GmbH](https://github.com/neuefische) , where I learned new skills on how to approach any data analytics projects.

:office: + :anchor: Prior to that I worked in international marine transport insurance and logistics crunching numbers, negotiating and purchasing insurance on behalf of large shipping clients.

:mortar_board: I got my B.Sc. degree in logistics and port economics with focus on transport policy and business informatics. 

🌱 On my next job I´d love to apply data analysis methods to solve logistical or insurance related challenges.

:basketball: In my spare time I´m also a basketball fan and stat head. 

🤝 If you are interested in a co-up, feel free to contact me on my email - <edgars_gaponenko@protonmail.com>!

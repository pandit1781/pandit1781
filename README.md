👋 Hi there! I'm Edgars. Originally from Riga, 🇱🇻 and now based in gorgeous city of Hamburg, 🇩🇪.

🚀 Recent graduate of Advanced Data Analytics Bootcamp at [neuefische GmbH](https://github.com/neuefische), where I honed my skills in tackling data analytics projects from scratch.

💼 I've primarily worked in international marine transport insurance and logistics in various roles, where I crunched numbers and data, negotiated deals, and purchased insurance for major shipping clients.

🎓 I hold a B.Sc. degree in Logistics and Port Economics, with a focus on transport policy and business informatics.

🌱 I'm eager to apply my technical data analysis skills and communication strenght to solve challenges in logistics or insurance in my next role as a data/business/performance/BI/product analyst/consultant.

🏀 In my spare time, I’m a basketball enthusiast and stats aficionado.

🤝 Let's connect! Feel free to reach out via email at <edgars_gaponenko@protonmail.com>!
